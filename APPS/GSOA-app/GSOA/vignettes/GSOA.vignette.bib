abstract = {Although in some cases individual genomic aberrations may drive disease development in isolation, a complex interplay among multiple aberrations is common. Accordingly, we developed Gene Set Omic Analysis (GSOA), a bioinformatics tool that can evaluate multiple types and combinations of omic data at the pathway level. GSOA uses machine learning to identify dysregulated pathways and improves upon other methods because of its ability to decipher complex, multigene patterns. We compare GSOA to alternative methods and demonstrate its ability to identify pathways known to play a role in various cancer phenotypes. Software implementing the GSOA method is freely available from https://bitbucket.org/srp33/gsoa.},
